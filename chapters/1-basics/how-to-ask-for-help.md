# How to find more help

Microscopy is a very technical field that combined wide range of topics (hence this *handbook*).

It is necessary to seek additional help, assistances, or clarifications when planning experiments, thinking about new setups, acquiring data for the first time, or just trying to understand how particular experiment is done and what limitations it might have.

Nobody knows everything and sharing within microscopy community is part of culture. However, one need to know how to efficiently seek assistance and how to make sure your colleagues will be glad answer your questions in the future.
