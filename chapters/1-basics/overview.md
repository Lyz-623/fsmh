# What makes a microscope?



## Optics

Microscope is a tool that magnifies small things to appear large by creating a virtual image that is much larger than the original object (sample).

Modern microscopes are built with infinity-corrected microscopy objectives that create final image on the sensor. It is easy to understand such system using [two-lens approximation](https://www.microscopyu.com/tutorials/twolenssystem)

In modern microscopes the first lens can be called "objective" and second one "tube lens". Together these lenses create magnified image away from the sample plane.
